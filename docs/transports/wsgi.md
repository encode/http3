# The WSGI transport

You can configure an `httpx` client to call directly into a Python web application using the WSGI protocol.

This is particularly useful for two main use-cases:

* Using `httpx` as a client inside test cases.
* Mocking out external services during tests or in dev or staging environments.

## Using `WSGITransport`

Here's an example of integrating against a Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask
import httpx


app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

transport = httpx.WSGITransport(app=app)
with httpx.Client(transport=transport, base_url="http://testserver") as client:
    r = client.get("/")
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert r.text == "Hello World!"
```

## Configuration

For some more complex cases you might need to customize the WSGI transport. This allows you to:

* Inspect 500 error responses rather than raise exceptions by setting `raise_app_exceptions=False`.
* Mount the WSGI application at a subpath by setting `script_name` (WSGI).
* Use a given client address for requests by setting `remote_addr` (WSGI).

For example:

```python
# Instantiate a client that makes WSGI requests with a client IP of "1.2.3.4".
transport = httpx.WSGITransport(app=app, remote_addr="1.2.3.4")
with httpx.Client(transport=transport, base_url="http://testserver") as client:
    ...
```
