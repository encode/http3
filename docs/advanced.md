# Advanced Usage

## Client Instances

Using a Client instance to make requests will give you HTTP connection pooling,
will provide cookie persistence, and allows you to apply configuration across
all outgoing requests.

```python
>>> client = httpx.Client()
>>> r = client.get('https://example.org/')
>>> r
<Response [200 OK]>
```

## Calling into Python Web Apps

You can configure an `httpx` client to call directly into a Python web
application, using either the WSGI or ASGI protocol.

This is particularly useful for two main use-cases:

* Using `httpx` as a client, inside test cases.
* Mocking out external services, during tests or in dev/staging environments.

Here's an example of integrating against a Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask
import httpx


app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

client = httpx.Client(app=app)
r = client.get('http://example/')
assert r.status_code == 200
assert r.text == "Hello World!"
```

For some more complex cases you might need to customize the WSGI or ASGI
dispatch. This allows you to:

* Inspect 500 error responses, rather than raise exceptions, by setting `raise_app_exceptions=False`.
* Mount the WSGI or ASGI application at a subpath, by setting `script_name` (WSGI) or `root_path` (ASGI).
* Use a given the client address for requests, by setting `remote_addr` (WSGI) or `client` (ASGI).

For example:

```python
# Instantiate a client that makes WSGI requests with a client IP of "1.2.3.4".
dispatch = httpx.dispatch.WSGIDispatch(app=app, remote_addr="1.2.3.4")
client = httpx.Client(dispatch=dispatch)
```

## Build Request

You can use `Client.build_request()` to build a request and
make modifications before sending the request.

```python
>>> client = httpx.Client()
>>> req = client.build_request("OPTIONS", "https://example.com")
>>> req.url.full_path = "*"  # Build an 'OPTIONS *' request for CORS
>>> client.send(r)
<Response [200 OK]>
```

## Specify the version of HTTP protocol

One can set the version of HTTP protocol for the client in case you want to make the requests using specific version.

For example:

```python
h11_client = httpx.Client(http_versions=["HTTP/1.1"])
h11_response = h11_client.get("https://myserver.com")

h2_client = httpx.Client(http_versions=["HTTP/2"])
h2_response = h2_client.get("https://myserver.com")
```

## .netrc Support

HTTPX supports .netrc file. In `trust_env=True` cases, if auth parameter is
not defined, HTTPX tries to add auth into request's header from .netrc file.

As default `trust_env` is true. To set false:
```python
>>> httpx.get('https://example.org/', trust_env=False)
```

If `NETRC` environment is empty, HTTPX tries to use default files.
(`~/.netrc`, `~/_netrc`)

To change `NETRC` environment:
```python
>>> import os
>>> os.environ["NETRC"] = "my_default_folder/.my_netrc"
```

.netrc file content example:
```
machine netrcexample.org
login example-username
password example-password

...
```

## HTTP Proxying

HTTPX supports setting up proxies the same way that Requests does via the `proxies` parameter.
For example to forward all HTTP traffic to `http://127.0.0.1:3080` and all HTTPS traffic
to `http://127.0.0.1:3081` your `proxies` config would look like this:

```python
>>> client = httpx.Client(proxies={
  "http": "http://127.0.0.1:3080",
  "https": "http://127.0.0.1:3081"
})
```

Proxies can be configured for a specific scheme and host, all schemes of a host,
all hosts for a scheme, or for all requests. When determining which proxy configuration
to use for a given request this same order is used.

```python
>>> client = httpx.Client(proxies={
    "http://example.com":  "...",  # Host+Scheme
    "all://example.com":  "...",  # Host
    "http": "...",  # Scheme
    "all": "...",  # All
})
>>> client = httpx.Client(proxies="...")  # Shortcut for 'all'
```

!!! warning
    To make sure that proxies cannot read your traffic,
    and even if the proxy_url uses HTTPS, it is recommended to
    use HTTPS and tunnel requests if possible.

By default `HTTPProxy` will operate as a forwarding proxy for `http://...` requests
and will establish a `CONNECT` TCP tunnel for `https://` requests. This doesn't change
regardless of the `proxy_url` being `http` or `https`.

Proxies can be configured to have different behavior such as forwarding or tunneling all requests:

```python
proxy = httpx.HTTPProxy(
    proxy_url="https://127.0.0.1",
    proxy_mode=httpx.HTTPProxyMode.TUNNEL_ONLY
)
client = httpx.Client(proxies=proxy)

# This request will be tunnelled instead of forwarded.
client.get("http://example.com")
```
