# Requests Compatibility Guide

HTTPX aims to be compatible with the `requests` API wherever possible.

This documentation outlines places where the API differs...

## QuickStart

Pretty much any API mentioned in the `requests` QuickStart should be identical
to the API in our own documentation. The following exceptions apply:

* `Response.url` - Returns a `URL` instance, rather than a string. Use `str(response.url)` if you need a string instance.
* `httpx.codes` - In our documentation we prefer the uppercased versions, such as `codes.NOT_FOUND`,
but also provide lower-cased versions for API compatibility with `requests`.
* `stream=True`. - Streaming responses provide the `.stream()` and `.raw()` byte iterator interfaces, rather than the `.iter_content()` method and the `.raw` socket interface.
* `.get`, `.delete`, `.head`, `.options` -  These methods do not support `files`, `data`, or `json` arguments. Use `.request` if you need to need to send data using these http methods.

## Advanced Usage

### requests.Session
The HTTPX equivalent of `requests.Session` is `httpx.Client`.

```python
session = requests.Session(**kwargs)
```

is equivalent to

```python
with httpx.Client(**kwargs) as client:
    ...
```

More detailed documentation and usage of `Client` can be found in [Advanced Usage](advanced.md).

## Mocking

If you need to mock HTTPX the same way that test utilities like `responses` and `requests-mock` does for `requests`, see [RESPX](https://github.com/lundberg/respx).
